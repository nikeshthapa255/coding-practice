# Pointers of my notes

1. Talk about time and space complexity of your implementation
2. Write Test case for your code
3. Just write code first and then think about refinements
4. Prepare for open ended questions
    - ability to learn and explain your thought process
    - use data driven decision
5. Keep pointers of Leadership roles
    - achivements
    - guided or helped to achieve
    - How I work individually
    - how I work in ambiguity
    - How I behave when I push outside my comfort zone
6. Showcase your skills
    - Your smart ness and ability to adapt to diffent roles
    - quick learner
7. Ask more questions
8. Don't miss silly edge cases like - if empty case, equals to count case.
