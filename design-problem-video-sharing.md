Creating a detailed plan for learning about each topic relevant to building a video sharing platform will involve structured steps. Here's a framework for each of the main topics:

### 1. Microservices Architecture

#### Basics and Theory:
Understand the fundamental concepts of microservices, including their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages compared to monolithic architectures. Learn about services decomposition, independent deployment, and inter-service communication.

#### Application to Video Sharing Platform:
Explore how a video sharing platform can be divided into microservices, e.g., User Service, Video Metadata Service, Video Storage Service, and Analytics Service. Discuss how these services can communicate and scale independently.

#### In-Depth Concepts:
Delve into microservices design patterns, service discovery, API gateways, and the challenges of distributed systems like data consistency and transaction management.

### 2. Data Modeling and Databases

#### Basics and Theory:
Learn about different database types (relational vs. NoSQL) and their use cases. Understand data modeling concepts and how to design schemas based on the data access patterns.

#### Application to Video Sharing Platform:
Design data models for user profiles, video metadata, comments, and likes/dislikes. Choose the appropriate database based on query patterns, e.g., using NoSQL for flexible video metadata and relational databases for user data.

#### In-Depth Concepts:
Study database normalization, indexing, sharding, replication, and consistency models. Learn about data partitioning strategies and database optimization techniques.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

#### Basics and Theory:
Understand the principles of authentication, authorization, and secure session management. Learn about different authentication methods, such as tokens, OAuth, and JWT.

#### Application to Video Sharing Platform:
Implement user authentication for login and registration. Design authorization rules to manage who can upload, edit, or delete videos and how users can access different resources based on their roles.

#### In-Depth Concepts:
Explore OpenID Connect, role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.

### 4. Scalability and Performance Optimization

#### Basics and Theory:
Learn about scalability fundamentals, including horizontal vs. vertical scaling, load balancing, and caching strategies.

#### Application to Video Sharing Platform:
Discuss how to scale the video sharing platform during high traffic, such as implementing CDN for video content, using load balancers, and applying caching for frequently accessed data.

#### In-Depth Concepts:
Deep dive into advanced topics like database sharding, connection pooling, and rate limiting. Understand the trade-offs of different scalability strategies.

- High Scalability blog for real-world scalability stories and solutions

### 5. Error Handling, Logging, and Monitoring

#### Basics and Theory:
Understand the importance of robust error handling, structured logging, and effective monitoring in maintaining application health and performance.

#### Application to Video Sharing Platform:
Implement systematic error handling and logging in the platform's backend. Set up monitoring tools to track application performance, error rates, and user metrics.

#### In-Depth Concepts:
Learn about different logging levels, log aggregation tools, and creating actionable alerts. Explore monitoring best practices and tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.

- Official documentation and tutorials for ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana

For each topic, start with the basics to build a strong foundation, then apply what you've learned to the context of the video sharing platform. Next, delve into the in-depth concepts to understand the nuances and advanced techniques. Lastly, refer to the recommended resources for a deeper dive into each subject. This structured approach will help you develop a comprehensive understanding of each area, crucial for a holistic software engineer, especially in a Google interview context.
